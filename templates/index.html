    <h1>PyPSA-Eur-Sec optimisation server</h1>
    <p>This interface allows you to run custom optimisations for a sector-coupled model of the European energy system, <a href="https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur-sec">PyPSA-Eur-Sec</a>. You can, for example, explore different scenarios to reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions across electricity, heating, transport and industry.</p>

    <p>The model minimises the costs of the energy system assuming all capacity investments in generation, storage, energy conversion and energy transport can be re-optimised. Energy services (electricity, heating, transport, industrial demand) are provided at today's levels by default, but they can also be altered. Default cost assumptions are taken from forecasts for 2050, mainly from the <a href="https://ens.dk/en/our-services/projections-and-models/technology-data">Danish Energy Agency Technology Data</a>. 45 regions are assumed. A full year of representative weather and load data is used, but sampled n-hourly.</p>

    <h3>Actions</h3>

    <p><a href="submit">Submit a new scenario</a></p>
    <p><a href="results">See previously calculated scenarios</a></p>

    <h3>Only free software and open data</h3>
    <p>The user interface and optimisation model construction and
       post-processing are all built with free software and open data
       only. The commercial optimisation
       solver <a href="https://www.gurobi.com">Gurobi</a> is used for
       its high performance on this website, but it can also be
       replaced with an open source solver such
       as <a href="https://github.com/coin-or/Clp">Clp</a> if
       performance is not required.  The code for all parts except the
       solver can be downloaded from the GitHub
       repository <a href="https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-server">pypsa-server</a>. It
       uses the <a href="https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA">Python for
       Power System Analysis (PyPSA)</a> energy optimisation
       framework, open weather data from the European Centre for
       Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
       (ECMWF) <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels">ERA5
       reanalysis dataset</a>,
       the <a href="https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite">atlite
       library</a> for converting weather data to generation profiles,
       and free software for the server infrastructure (GNU/Linux,
       nginx, Flask, gunicorn, Redis).</p>
